Grandstream Toolkit Package
===========================

The Grandstream Toolkit is a collection of scripts, mainly PHP and bash, to provide control of Grandstream devices within an open source environment.
This particularly means Asterisk, FreePBX on Linux and BSD. Some scripts also make use of the GSUtil utility from Packets Consulting.

Examples of usage are provided in each transport type, though the examples directory also gives specific contexts to make use of the scripts.
